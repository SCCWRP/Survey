# Survey
Survey wizard for rapid application development

A tool for building web and mobile surveys on-the-fly. You fill in your questions and select your form elements and the back-end tables, front-end web application, and restful middleware is built on submit. Tool was shelved since ESRI came out with Survey123, but still has lots of useful code that could be of use in future projects.
